Notations for the following "notation and notes":
Stuff in quotation marks are the strings being decoded.
"n", "m" represents a number

Algorithm notation and notes:
For subtraction in functions, use _ instead of - or add negative.
'-' represent negative and it only goes in front of numbers. (e.g. "-l(2)" is a no);
Order of operations does not exist, except for parentheses (implement recursively).
Do not put in spaces. No implicit multiplication (e.g. "7n").
Division returns the exact value (double).
"l(n)" = log(n); // which is ln(n)
"s(n)" = sin(n); // n is always in radians.
Always follow logs and sins with parentheses. Do not place parentheses in logs', though.
"(n^m)" = pow(n, m);
"S" = STR
"D" = DEX
"E" = END
"I" = INT
"L" = LUK
examples:
"3+2^2" = pow(3 + 2, 2) = 25
"3+(2^2)" = 3 + pow(2,2) = 7
"5/S+4*D" = ((5 / STR) + 4) * DEX)

"An" = make n separate attacks. ex: "A2" = make two attacks
